## snp.dat
This is an example dataset to show how to use medeas. The data where generated using a coalescence simualtion software (scrm). The data was then post-process to match medeas format.

We simulated three populations of 25 individuals with each 10'000 Loci. All the population sizes are constant. The first split happen at D = 0.2 and the second one at D = 0.4 (in unit of N) (which in unit of scrm is D = 0.1 and D = 0.2 since they work in unit of 2N).
